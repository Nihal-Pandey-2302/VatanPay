## Overview

VatanPay is a blockchain-based remittance platform that enables Indian migrant workers in the Gulf to send money home **instantly** with **sub-1% fees** using the Stellar blockchain.

### The Problem

- Hidden exchange rate markups
- Limited operating hours

### The Solution

- **0.5% platform fee** (90% savings)
- **~5 second settlement** time
- Transparent real-time exchange rates
- 24/7 availability
- Powered by Stellar blockchain

```

### Three-Layer Architecture

#### 1. Frontend Layer (React + Chakra UI)

- User interface for sending/receiving money
- Wallet connection (Freighter)
- Real-time exchange rate display
- Transaction history

#### 2. Blockchain Layer (Stellar + Soroban)

- **Smart Contract**: Escrow and transaction management
- **Stellar DEX**: Automatic currency conversion
- **Path Payments**: Multi-hop trading (USDC→XLM→INR)
- **Network Fees**: ~$0.00001 per transaction

#### 3. Infrastructure Layer (MoneyGram)

- Fiat on-ramp (Cash AED → USDC)
- Fiat off-ramp (INR Tokens → Cash INR)
- KYC/AML compliance
- Global settlement network

---

## MoneyGram Integration

### Why MoneyGram?

VatanPay partners with **MoneyGram** because they already have the physical infrastructure that blockchain startups lack:

- **500,000+ locations** in 180 countries
- **Licensed & Regulated** for cash handling
- **Existing Stellar integration** for USDC settlement

### The Hybrid Model

Instead of issuing our own risky tokens, we leverage the **USDC stablecoin** running on MoneyGram's network.

#### 1. Cash In (MoneyGram)

- **User Action:** Deposits physical AED cash at MoneyGram Dubai location.
- **System Action:** MoneyGram issues equivalent **USDC** to user's VatanPay wallet.
- **Trust:** User trusts MoneyGram (regulated entity), not VatanPay.

#### 2. Instant Transfer (VatanPay)

- **User Action:** Presses "Send" in VatanPay app.
- **System Action:** USDC is transferred via Stellar to recipient's wallet in 5 seconds.
- **Efficiency:** VatanPay provides the slick mobile UX that MoneyGram lacks.

#### 3. Cash Out (MoneyGram)

- **User Action:** Recipient visits MoneyGram Mumbai location.
- **System Action:** MoneyGram redeems USDC for physical INR cash.

### VatanPay's Role

We are the **Experience Layer** on top of MoneyGram's **Infrastructure Layer**.

- MoneyGram handles the "hard stuff" (Cash, Licenses, Compliance).
- VatanPay handles the "easy stuff" (Mobile App, Instant Transfer, User Experience).

### On-Ramp Process (Real Money → Tokens)

```mermaid

    participant Worker
    participant MoneyGram
    participant Stellar as Stellar Network
    participant VatanPay as VatanPay App

    Worker->>MoneyGram: 1. Deposit 1,000 AED
    MoneyGram->>Stellar: 2. Issue ~272 USDC
    Stellar->>Worker: 3. USDC arrives in wallet
    Worker->>VatanPay: 4. Connect Wallet & Send
```

**Steps:**

1.  Worker deposits **real AED** to a MoneyGram agent.
2.  Agent verifies deposit and KYC.
3.  MoneyGram issues **USDC** to worker's wallet at current exchange rate.
4.  Worker opens VatanPay to send money.

**VatanPay serves as the "Venmo" interface**, while MoneyGram acts as the "Bank".

### Off-Ramp Process (Tokens → Real Money)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Family
    participant VatanPay as VatanPay App
    participant Stellar as Stellar Network
    participant MoneyGram
    participant Cash

    Family->>VatanPay: 1. Receive INR Tokens
    VatanPay->>Stellar: 2. Send INR to MoneyGram
    Stellar->>MoneyGram: 3. Transfer tokens
    MoneyGram->>Cash: 4. Dispense Cash
    Cash->>Family: 5. Money received!
```

**Steps:**

1.  Family receives INR tokens (converted from USDC) in VatanPay app.
2.  Clicks "Withdraw Cash".
3.  VatanPay routes tokens to a **MoneyGram India** agent.
4.  Agent hands over **real INR** cash.

**Why this works:**

- **Non-Custodial**: VatanPay never holds fiat currency
- **Regulatory Compliance**: MoneyGram handles KYC/AML
- **Scalability**: We focus on software, MoneyGram handles cash
- **Stability**: USDC is fully backed and trusted

### Detailed Step-by-Step

**Phase 1: Preparation (One-time)**

1. ✅ Worker installs Freighter wallet
2. ✅ Worker deposits real AED to **Partner Anchor**
3. ✅ Partner Anchor issues AED tokens to Worker's wallet
4. ✅ Recipient family creates Stellar wallet

**Phase 2: Sending Money (Every transaction)**

1. Worker opens VatanPay app at `https://vatanpay.app`
2. Connects Freighter wallet
3. Enters:
   - Amount in AED (e.g., 1,000 AED)
   - Recipient's Stellar address
4. Reviews transaction summary:
   - Exchange rate: `1 AED = 22.50 INR` (real-time from DEX)
   - Platform fee: `5 AED (0.5%)`
   - Network fee: `~0.00001 XLM`
   - **Recipient receives: ₹22,375 INR**
5. Clicks "Send Money" and approves in Freighter
6. **Transaction completes in ~5 seconds**

**Phase 3: Behind the Scenes (Automated)**

```
Step 1: Smart contract locks 1,000 AED in escrow
Step 2: Stellar executes path payment:
        - Sell 1,000 AED for XLM (DEX order book)
        - Sell XLM for ~22,500 INR (DEX order book)
Step 3: 22,375 INR tokens arrive in recipient's wallet
Step 4: Smart contract marks transaction "completed"
```

**Phase 4: Recipient Withdrawal**

1. Family opens VatanPay app
2. Sees "₹22,375 INR" balance
3. Clicks "Withdraw to Bank"
4. Enters Indian bank account/UPI ID
5. **Partner Anchor** sends real INR to bank within 5 minutes

- **Availability**: 24/7 vs business hours only

### Is my money safe?

Yes, multiple layers of security:

- Smart contracts are audited and immutable

### Do I need crypto knowledge?

No! The app abstracts all blockchain complexity:

- You think in AED and INR (not tokens)
